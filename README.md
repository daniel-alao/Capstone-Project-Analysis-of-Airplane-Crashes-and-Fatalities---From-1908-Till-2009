Project Objective: 

a)To conduct an indepth analysis of Airplane Crashes and Fatlities since from 1908 - 2009.

b)To find the year with the most fatalities.

c)To discover what year had the most survivals and why.

d)To know which countries have both the highest and lowest fatalities

#  Data Sourcing : The data used to execute this project was gotten from https://aka.ms/30DLDATGitHubRepo
The data used was then scraped and imported into PowerBI for cleaning and fixing before analysis.

# Data Transformation : The data consisting of tables had anomalies like blank rows, columns with wrong data types, among others when imported. 
Using the'Transform data' feature,  In summary,the following steps were taken:

i)Columns with blank values were replaced with "Null". Those with the whol number data types were replaced with '0'.

ii)The 'Month' column was created by using the 'Add New Column' on the Home Ribbon. Afterwards, the 'Date' column was selected and the new columns 'Month Name' and 'Year' were created.


# Findings : After cleaning of the data, the following are the gotten findings:

**_Overview Discovery:_**

i)Total passengers aboard across those years summed up to **144,551.**

ii)Total fatalities from 1908 - 2009 summed up toa figure of **105,497**

iii) Survivor figure summed up to **39,193** people, with a fatality ratio of **0.73**

**_Discovery from Dashboard:_**

iv) Fatalities was highest for **Russia at **6575, followed by Brazil and Colombia**.

v)Russia accounted for **6.23%** of Fatalities.

vi)Across all 605 Country, Fatalities ranged from **0 to 6575.**

vii)The year **1999** has some interesting insights. Out of _2758_ people aboard, _1788_ survived the crash, with a fatality figure of _970._

viii)The Year **1972** records the highest fatalities of _2937_ of  _3635_ people on board ,due to mechanical, technical failures, pilot faults, etc.

ix) Fatalities was highest for Douglas DC-3 at 4793, followed by Antonov AN-26 and Douglas DC-6B.



x)Douglas DC-3 accounted for 4.54% of Fatalities.

xi)Across all **2,407 Type, Fatalities ranged from 0 to 4793.**



# Reccomendations :
a)Having seen that the causes of crashes was mostly due to mechanical,technical faults, weather conditions and human error.

b)It should be ensured that aircrafts should be properly maintained and cross-checke before passing it for flight.

c)Also, due to climate change in our days, there should be more accurate weather forecasting measures put into place before an aircraft is flown.

While these are done, other reasons for crashes shouldn't be ignored, but well nipped in the bud, so as to mitigate diasters and loss of lives.
